# Machine learning workflows for developers

This repository has materials from a hands-on tutorial on machine learning workflows and using OpenShift for these.  The goal of this workshop is to get application developers comfortable with some of the habits, concerns, and practices necessary to effectively incorporate machine learning workflows into their general engineering discipline.  One notable aspect of the lab is that we offer students the opportunity to solve a real problem with machine learning in five fundamentally different ways -- and these approaches are quick enough to evaluate that attendees will be able to try out several and see which performs the best!

이 repository에는 machine learning workflow에 대한 hands-on tutorial과 OpenShift를 사용한 material이 있습니다. 이 workshop의 goal은 application developer가 machine learning workflow를 general engineering discipline에 effectively하게 incorporate하는 데 necessary한 habit, concern 및 practice에 comfortable하도록 하는 것입니다. Lab의 하나의 notable aspect는 machine learning의 real problem를 fundamentally하게 5가지 different way로 solve할 수 있는 opprtunity를 offer한다는 것입니다. these approach는 attendee가 몇 가지를 try out해 보고 어떤 것이 best로 perform하는지 확인할 수 있을 정도로 quick합니다.

Our slides from presenting the lab at Red Hat Summit 2019 are available [as a PDF](./slides/rendered/ml-workflows-for-developers.pdf) or [as a movie](./slides/rendered/ml-workflows-for-developers.m4v).

This repository is also intended to demonstrate the [new reproducible workshops standards](https://github.com/sophwats/reproducible-workshops) that are currently under development.  We've intentionally let it fall short of the standard in places and have [filed issues](https://github.com/willb/openshift-ml-workflows-workshop/issues) about these shortcomings.  Feedback is welcome.
